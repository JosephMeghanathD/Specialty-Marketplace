        "Welcome to the Specialty Marketplace showcase! This application was developed as the final project for the **Advanced System Project (ASP)** course at the **University of Central Missouri (UCM)**.",
        "The primary goal of this project was to design, develop, and implement a comprehensive full-stack web application demonstrating key concepts learned throughout the course. It simulates a niche e-commerce platform, focusing on building robust backend services with Java Spring Boot and a modern, interactive frontend using React.",
        "Key technical features implemented include user authentication (JWT), RESTful API design, product and category management, order processing simulation, and database integration (MySQL/PostgreSQL). While presented as an e-commerce site, the core focus was on the technical architecture and implementation process.",
        "This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating various technologies to create a functional and scalable web system."
